# Random-Sensor

A heart rate sensor is pretty straightforward. It detects heartbeats by measuring changes in blood volume. I decided to use the sensor to create a heart regulator system. Basically, if your heart rate is high, it will play a very slow and tranquil song, if your heart rate is low, it will play a fast-paced song, and if it is normal, it will play a regular song that keep you heart beat steady. It will also show you heart rate graph on the OLED Monitor.
